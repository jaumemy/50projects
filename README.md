## Info

I have done lots of little projects like:       

* A fun sound board
* A cool incrementing counter for social media followers/subscribers
* A vampire game to fill the cup with blood
* A movie app to check on the most relevant films at the time or search for more
* A drawing app to maybe play with someone or just have some fun
* A button that shows positive and good vibes-only notifications
* A useful Github user finder
* And much more that I have done and will do in the future...
      


              
## Technologies

For this project, I used **Html**, **Css** and **Javascript**, with no libraries or frameworks. Also some cool **APIs** for info.       
I deployed it on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and experimented with different kinds of paid dynos, so that it would load faster.   
               
               
                 
## Motivation

I had a lot of of fun doing this cool projects and I used it to learn enough to be able to code my personal website from scratch myself.             
I added more projects to the course I was doing so that I could learn even more.                    
_I was following Udemy's Course [50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/). by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop._
